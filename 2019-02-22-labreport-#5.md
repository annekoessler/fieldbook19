In today's lab, we had the opportunity to set type for a piece of writing that we picked with our partners. My partner and I decided on the Robert Frost poem, "Nothing Gold Can Stay", which is short enough to make it possible to set most of the type in this lab. Also, the poem still resonates with us and it was one of our favorites growing up, so it was special to make these words come alive through this lab. Thanks to our last lab, this lab went more smoothly as we have already familiarized ourselves with the information needed in order to complete our tasks. Interestingly enough, I found that this lab went by quicker and was less difficult when we were able to work with a poem we could pick. Some might argue that it was easier since we were already exposed to the letter press a week ago, but I was also more motivated in setting type for Robert Frost's poem since I genuinely enjoyed what each line said. Therefore, it felt even better to physically set these lines letter-by-letter knowing that it was Frost's words. 

We took a different approach this time when setting type; instead of starting with the first line of the poem, we decided to set type for the line that had the most letters and therefore was the longest. Doing this first ensured that we had tightened our trays at the perfect length so there would be no risk of some words not fitting on the line that it is originally apart of. Especially in poetry, form is extremely important so it was crucial that we respect this layout and ensure that words were placed in relation to one another like they should be in the poem. We did run into some difficulty here though. It was difficult to move this long line, which was the eighth out of ninth line, since it was literally the second-to-last line. As we proceeded down the poem in the normal order, we had to be careful when moving this eighth line with the lead since we did not want to mix up the order. However, this slight inconvenience was worth it since it assured me that there would be no error in the poem's form when we set up the type. I believe one of the most important foundations of poetry is in its form, and form is also one of its biggest characteristics. When there is an enjambment of a word solely because it didn't fit along the lead, the poems meaning could be severely altered with this new emphasis on a word pushed to the next line alone. We, of course, would never want this to be the case! 

Another integral component in setting type is the en space. In Lindsay Lynch's "How I Came to Love the En Space", she describes the en space's purpose in a simple yet glorifying way: "It just holds printable type together in a tight grid, creating spaces between words. It is never seen, but without it, everything printed would be nonsense." My favorite part about this quote is the last sentence, how printed material would be "nonsense" without the en space. And this is very true; although the en space is often overlooked, when compared to a letter, it would be nearly impossible to set type without en spaces. En spaces organize the page neatly and allow what your typing to be readable, and simply, make sense. In our lab, I noticed how quickly we ran out of en spaces in our California Job Case since we were using them so frequently. (Again, this further shows how important this component is for the letter press process!) Because we were running out, I had to check out the extra en spaces and figure out which en space matched the one we used. 

While setting type is still relatively new to me, I found Lynch's description of understanding letterpress printing to be extremely beneficial. Lynch writes:

*To understand letterpress printing, imagine that every letter you see on your screen is an object, a tiny piece of metal. Not only is every letter an object, but every space between every letter is also an object. Every space between words, every space between linesâ€”every bit of white space is an object. When typesetting, a printer has to think about negative space as something tangible.* 

When typing on a computer, we often never think of spaces as "objects" or something material like letters in a word are. This was the initial struggle I had with the en space; it was hard to distinguish between all the different kinds of en spaces and then utilizing them in my work. However, I think Lynch beautifully describes the en space in a way that made me appreciate this component of the letterpress even more. When she says, "When typesetting, a printer has to think about negative space as something tangible" I was at first confused by this statement. How can negative space be something tangible? However, this statement became much clearer when I was setting type in the lab. Negative space has the ability to being something tangible since the en space is not only a tangible key, but it is also literally just negative space. This negative space is crucial to produce a legible line of text. 

I think Lynch masterfully portrays the en space as one of the most important items of this process. If we ran out of the letter "w", we could always substitute it with two lower case "v's" (vv) and there's always the option to just insert that letter in a different font. However, when we run out of en spaces, there is a far bigger problem. We can't replace en spaces with any other keys since it will imprint whatever letter or character is imprinted on it. While there is the option to use a bigger or smaller en space, this would honesty just look stranger (at least to me) then a "w" being replaced with two "v's". Consistency is key in producing a beautiful line of text, so we must respect the kind of en spaces we use. Understanding en spaces as these "tangible negative spaces" not only helped me through this lab, but it also strengthened my understanding of its overall significance in letter press printing.
