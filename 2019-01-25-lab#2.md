Unsurprisingly, there are several different kinds of mediums that have spanned the course of our history, from a papyrus plant to paper from a tree. It was exciting to explore a collection of different media spanning the past centuries in the Northeastern Archives, ranging from medieval manuscripts to printed history text books from the 18th century. I was the most gravitated towards two codices in this archive exploration: the "Dragon Prayer Book" (after 1461) and Ovid's *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* (1546). Simply put, my fascination with these mediums stems from my lack of knowledge of the time periods these texts came from and the interesting details imbedded in each work. In addition, I chose Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex *Arundel* as another codex to dissect further from a scanned image online. This text seemed a bit different in subject matter from the other two texts and included drawings, which I found very engaging. By comparing the three openings between these three codices, I've reflected back on Bonnie Mak's "Architectures of the Page" since the concepts/descriptions she details came to life in this lab.

First, I want to list the similarities I noticed between the two physical books, the "Dragon Prayer Book" and Ovid's *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria*: 

* Color is implemented
* Ornate letters are at the beginning of some lines
* Lines/margins are implemented 

While both books had color and ornate letters, they varied slightly. The "Dragon Prayer Book" had a much more colorful palette that was actually ingrained in the text itself, while *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* just had a red color on the book's edges and this color was not particularly within the text itself (except for the margins surrounding the text, which were red). In addition, while the opening I chose for *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* did have an intricate letterform on the first page, there was no color within this design. While the illustration of this letter "L" was beautiful, it was odd that no color was included; perhaps this did not make sense during the production of this book (since it did contain more text than the "Dragon Prayer Book" which implemented much more color). In the opening I chose for the "Dragon Prayer Book", some larger letters and other details (music notes) were either a dark blue color, a bright red color or a teal-green color. This choice of color and the oversized size of the letter(s) led me to think about when Bonnie Mak discusses how letterforms revealed more about the text than one would think: 

*"By generating a particular visual expression, the shapes of letters may, for instance, exploit the authority of an established tradition or diverge self-consciously from conventional patterns."*

It is clear that including such an intricate letterform with bold colors indicates that this book was important since it wanted to highlight some parts of the text that would "diverge self-consciously from conventional patterns." In addition, such an intricate and boldly colored letterform was what enticed me in the first place, and this speaks multitudes to why this was implemented in the first place: to display this manuscript in an artistic and carefully crafted way. Everyone appreciates hard work, especially in art, so that is something I really enjoyed when analyzing this opening. On the other hand, I did not get the same feeling from the opening I chose from *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria*, which makes sense since it was created about 100 years later. As time evolves, so does the method of creating a text and priorities may shift in this shift. Instead of focusing on the "artistic" aspect of this book, there would be more of a focus on using the page effectively which would explain why there is more text in *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria*'s opening and how the margins were implemented to organize the page neatly. Without the distraction of such ornate letterforms, perhaps more information could be transcribed. Finally, I also noticed that the "Dragon Prayer Book" did have subtle lines below the words, which could be for the purpose of organization as well. These lines would help the scribe navigate the page as he or she carefully wrote on its parchment.

Next, I want to list the differences I saw between these two codices:

* The type of medium used:
    * "Dragon Prayer Book": parchment 
    * *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria*: linen rags
* The binding used
* Page numbers/ lack of page numbers 
* Small artistic details within the text

The most obvious difference I noticed was the type of medium each codex used. Since the "Dragon Prayer Book" dates back past 1461, it makes sense why parchment was used since it was during the Middle Ages. The use of parchment also helped explain why the book was much smaller than *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria*'s codex; although we do not know which animal was used to make this, creating parchment required stretching animal skin, and there is only so many pages you can cut from this stretched skin. Therefore, it would be more useful to cut the pieces into smaller dimensions so you can get more out of each animal. This also led me to think about the binding of the "Dragon Prayer Book" and how it had a clasp/strap to add more pressure to the book to bound the pages more tightly together. This was important since animal skins easily contracted in response to changes in temperature and humidity. On the other hand, *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* was constructed from linen rags (as you could see the lines running inside the page under a certain light) and did not have or required the binding that the "Dragon Prayer Book" needed. 

Likewise, it was interesting to note that the *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* codex had page numbers nestled in the top corners. This implementation of page numbers is absent in the "Dragon Prayer Book" and therefore leads me to believe that the *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* codex was not written thought by thought, but rather could be printed or copied so it was possible to keep track of page numbers. This difference shows me how codices may have evolved, even only within 10 years; the use of page numbers indicates an important text since you have the ability to refer to a specific section at your convenience. Another difference I noticed was that the "Dragon Prayer Book" included more artistic details within the text, while the *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* codex did not. These details refer to the music notes found on the second page of the opening, which interject the text towards the middle of the page. Why were music notes included? Is this book intended for more purposes than reading? It makes me wonder whether these music notes act as an aid for story-telling; they could allow a break in the words to deliver something of importance in a melodious song. And who doesn't enjoy a bit of entertainment during a story?

Moving on, I finally want to compare the two codices I've described previously, the "Dragon Prayer Book" and Ovid's *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria*, with Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex *Arundel* (~1500). I chose this text since it was created in between the other two codices' time (after 1461 and 1546) and I thought that this would be an interesting trio to compare. First, I want to describe what I learned about this codex just by looking at it. My first thought was that this codex looked like a mathematical/scientific notebook with evenly drawn diagrams aligned with the text. When I realized that Leonardo Da Vinci was the author, I wanted to label this text as a textbook (because he is a well renowned designer) and the illustrations made more sense: perhaps these diagrams coordinate with the text to apply what he is saying in a visual way. 

It is difficult to think about what is similar between this codex and the other two since this book obviously seems to be a textbook while the other two are more ambiguous. All three codices were relatively created in the same century, but still encompassed very different ideas, which I find fascinating. It just shows how different cultures and people used several different kinds of mediums to write about even more different aspects, despite living close within each other. Another similarity I noticed was that all three openings look roughly worn or decayed; a sign that these were preserved throughout the years but still in a way "die" because of its age. 

Next, I want to list the differences I saw between Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex *Arundel* with the other two codices:

* Subject matter
* Type of medium used 
* Use or lack of illustrated diagrams

As I mentioned before, Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex *Arundel* was much more obvious in its subject matter due to the illustrated diagrams he used. Although I cannot read Italian, these diagrams helped me guess that the words were closely related to the image presented and this kind of association resembles a textbook most closely. The "Dragon Prayer Book" and Ovid's *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* were actually quite ambiguous in subject matter when compared to this other codex. In addition, I found that I was more distracted by the use of colors and music notes in the "Dragon Prayer Book" so that seemed like the most important quality of the book itself (which I know may not be true for everyone.) As for the *P. Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* codex, I mainly retained that this text seemed more widely attainable due to the use of page numbers. Finally, probably the most clear and important, I noticed that the *Arundel* codex was most likely transcribed on paper. Because this codex was related to the other two in the sense that it was created in a close time period, the type of medium used is important. Bonnie Mak wonderfully sums this up when she says that *"the choice to use parchment or paper – when both are available – conveys important information about the history of that particular page, the environment in which it was constructed, and the purpose and audience for which it was intended."*  

I want to focus on the last "important information" Mak listed: "the purpose and audience for which it was intended." When I realized that Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex *Arundel*'s medium was probably paper, compared to how the "Dragon Prayer Book" was made of parchment, I imagined the audiences/purpose for both. For Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex *Arundel*, I believe that his intended purpose was to spread his ideas about mathematics or science (I'm not sure what he specifically talks about) to an audience of scholars who would most likely use and apply this kind of information at the time. Using paper, a more accessible source, leads me to think that this text was "important" in a sense that it spreads ideas about educational fields. On the other hand, I believe that the "Dragon Prayer Book", using parchment, could have the purpose of immortalizing beauty and the significance of its text (Unfortunately I cannot read the language of the text so I cannot understand its subject). I associate beauty and art with how "important" this codex is because the process of creating parchment and all the illustrations was a separate art in itself.
