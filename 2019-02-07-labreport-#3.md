Transcribing with the only light source of a candle was such an interesting and, at times, straining experience. In our previous readings, we've learned so much about the importance of the scribe role that this seemed to overshadow the actual reality of what scribing in medieval times was really like. One of the first things I noticed in doing this lab was the lack of light that the candle provided. I had the piece of paper I was to copy from and then the piece of paper I wrote on, as a scribe would need to have in order to do his job. I moved my pages around, trying to get the best angle/set-up for the small flame to cast light on both pages. What I landed on was a method of placing the blank page on top of the text-filled page, moving it directly underneath each line of the text. This helped me keep track of my work, and removed the anxiety I felt when looking at the page as a whole (there was so much text tightly written). Another struggle I faced was understanding the handwriting of the original text; at times I could barely make out the words so I had to spend some time figuring out what each line said. For me, I found it most helpful to transcribe word by word (rather than copying down letter by letter). Doing the latter ended up in words that were not even readable/ were not words at all. By actually reading the words, it was easier to place my attention mainly on copying the exact handwriting of the author. However, in this process, it did burn up more time. In the 30 minutes we scribed, I had only gotten about 6 lines down (to be fair though, the text was extremely small and spilled from the left side of the page all the way to the right side.) Another frustration I felt during this lab was the constant eye-strain I felt. Due to the lack of light, my vision often blurred and at times my eyes seemed to cross as I tried to dechiper the small text. Had there been normal classroom light, I do not think the strain on my eyes would have been as strong as it was with the candle light. 

I can't believe that the scribing process contained so much physical pain, stress, and extreme labor. We only did this exercise for 30 minutes, while these scribes did this for a *living*, meaning they would be scribing from sunrise to sunset every day. Through this lab, I've gained appreciation for these people since the job is far more strenuous than I initially expected. The pressure of being a scribe was most palpable in the excerpts from Johannes Trithemius' *In Praise of Scribes*. While this reading hones in on scribes of spiritual text, it is important to acknowledge that the importance of scribes was all encompassing and that most scribed texts might have been religious. I found this quote from Chapter 6 interesting: 

*And while he scribes the good texts, he is introduced little by little to the great mysteries, and his inmost soul is magnificently illuminated. What we write we imprint more forcefully on our minds, because we take our time reading and writing.* 

There is some truth here; I can only imagine how influenced a scribe would be by the texts he was scribing since he spent all day reading it to do his job. However, I found it slightly ironic how the author exaggerates the scribe's soul as being "magnificently illuminated". Perhaps they are placing such immense stress on the "learning" and "reflective" side of scribing to erase the not-so-magnificent reality of its laborious work. This lab helped me place myself into the scribe's shoes, so after scribing by the candlelight, my reading of this quote changed. How can this job illuminate someone's soul? This seems very exaggerated now. In addition, I found the comments some scribes left in manuscripts extremely indicative of what scribes *actually* got out of their role, and not what Johannes Trithemius wrote: "Oh, my hand."; "As the harbor is welcome to the sailor, so is the last line to the scribe." etc. I especially related to the comment about the "hand" since mine was cramping oddly in our lab due to my moving of the page to get as much as candlelight as I could. 

When I thought about another "media adjacent" technology, the first thing that came to mind were lab gloves. (Fun fact about myself, I used to major in Nursing my freshmen year at Northeastern so I participated in several labs over the course of that year.) In my Microbiology lab, the use of gloves was extremely crucial in ensuring that your results were as accurate as possible in a lab setting. We worked with several bacteria, ranging from Staphylococcus aureus to Escherichia coli. For safety purposes, gloves protected us from any dangerous bacteria we worked with. You certainly would not want any Escherichia coli on your hands/backpacks! However, the way gloves affected my lab as a "media adjacent" technology was that it did not interfere with our lab results. There are so many kinds of bacteria naturally lingering on our skin and *especially* our hands (think about how many things we touch every day with our hands) that mixing any of these with a specific test we might have set up specifically with only 2 kinds of bacteria would mess up our results. It would also be extremely detrimental to our bacteria plates and any tools/materials we touched if we did not wear gloves. Likewise, contamination is at a greater risk when you do not wear gloves. The results would look completely different and therefore result in a waste of time and resources due to the need to start over (with gloves). While the candle light shaped the process of scribing, the use of lab gloves shapes the steps in the labs and ultimately affects the results of the experiment. Especially for labs, it is expected to act extra cautious and to be aware of your behavior; so not wearing gloves is not only negatively affecting your results, but it also breaks several important lab rules to begin with. 

Thinking about the relationship between wearing gloves in a scientific lab and its end results provided a deeper insight for me in this particular lab: we must not take for granted the evolution of both the printing process and the lab process. For printing, scribes eventually were no longer used since the rapid printing press gained so much popularity once it was introduced. However, does this kind of work printed on mass-produced paper make it less significant than the art of scribes writing on other mediums, such as parchment? There was more risk and pressure for scribes, from the permanent nature of each letter they stroked with pen to the lack of resources, such as light, that were available to them. In Chapter 7 of Johannes Trithemius' *In Praise of Scribes* he writes:

*He who ceases the work of a scribe because of printing is not a true friend of Scripture, because heeding no more than the present he takes no care to educate posterity... Printed books will never equal scribed books, especially because the spelling and ornamentation of some printed books is often neglected. Copying requires greater diligence.*

As we think about this evolution from hand-copying to printing, it's important to reflect on what is lost and gained between this change. Clearly, the loss of "spelling and ornamentation" is lost when we turn to printing our work. Some could also argue that the work of scribes has a deeper importance due to the hard work that goes into each page; it is certainly a work of art. However, the efficiency and faster rate of producing books through the printing press clearly has a much greater value over the slower and more intense rate of scribed books. Whatever you value more--intricate hand written care of the scribes or more easily spread and readable text from printing--is dependent on who you speak to (or read about). For Johannes Trithemius, it is clear that he believes that printed books are *nothing* compared to scribed ones since "copying requires greater diligence". So what's more important: the hard work (I got to experience in this lab) of the behind-the-scenes work of a manuscript or the ability to efficiently and clearly distribute text? This is a question I believe varies greatly from person to person.
