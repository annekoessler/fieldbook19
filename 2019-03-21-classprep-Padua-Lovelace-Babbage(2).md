The rest of the reading for Sydney Padua's *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer* was extremely engaging and I appreciated how the form (of the comic) interacted with the text and storyline. First, I enjoyed the introduction of a new character: Marian Evans or her better known alias, George Eliot. I found that I related the most with this character (minus the whole being an author aspect), especially towards the beginning of this chapter "User Experience." She seems the most relatable because despite being so unfamiliar with Babbage and Lovelace's machine, she has other redeeming qualities: being a writer. It is hard to understand what Babbage and Lovelace articulate, so I appreciated the presence of confusion here. 

I also found it interesting how many times she repeatedly denied being the author of her book and that it was "a friend George's novel." This constant dialogue: "I didn't write this silly book! I'm looking after what my good friend George wrote" is humorous to the reader because we know from the footnotes that she clearly is the author. Also, the illustrations of her face give off a vibe that she is lying and her quick defense of her book relies a sense of nervousness. While repeating this action is funny, it is also very indicative of this time. Several women had to write under a male pen name in order to be taken seriously in academic settings, and I believe Padua's repetition of this "tagline" represents this need. 

When Marian/George gets lost in the Analytical Engine, the comic and its illustrations truly transform the story. To begin with, there is a noticeable lack of footnotes in this section simply because the images do not need words because they speak for themselves. My favorite snapshot of this scene is from pages 174 to 175. These pages show a literal flowchart of all the different paths Marian/George can take in order to find her way out of this "maze". So far, this to me has been the most interactive part of the book and I found it exciting to see which arrow lead where; Am I going to a "Fatal Error" or will my "Access [be] Denied?" This was such a creative way for the form (the comic) to dominate the storyline, while also tying into Babbage's own use of flowcharts in his notes about the Analytical Engine.
