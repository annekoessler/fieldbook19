Lisa Gitelmen's "Print Culture (Other Than Codex): Job Printing and Its Importance" cleverly points out the evolution of how the word "print" is used. Today, when we say "I have to print my essay before class", you're most likely associating the action of printing with the action on your laptop/device that sends a signal to a printer and thus prints a copy of your work. While this may be true today, it is extremely important to acknowledge the historical and social associations with the action of "printing", since people in the 18th century did not have the luxuries of technology that we have today. Gitelmen nicely hashes out this stark difference between the meaning of "printed" then and now:

*Any textual artifact that is not handwritten or otherwise handmade letter by letter (such as typing) counts as "printed," while today, even the printer's hand has gone missing, because we have "become accustomed to speaking or writing of 'printers' not as people, but as machines" connected to our computers.*

I find it so interesting that most people today think of printers "not as people, but as machines." Evolving in this way--from real people manually doing this job to a inanimate machine spitting out hot pages--leaves me feeling oddly dissatisfied. While there are so many advantages to the way printing works today (the printer does wonders with fast production) it is still unsettling to think of the evolution of printing as a replacement of people with machines. However, is it okay for this replacement to occur? Printing can be a mundane and time-intensive task which machines can more rapidly and effectively do the job; so, isn't it more beneficial to our society to simply choose the most ideal way to do something? I also found it fascinating that textual artifacts that were not handwritten would be considered "printed" several centuries ago. Using the word "handwritten" is crucial here since it humanizes the task of printing and makes the switch over to the missing printer's hand even more intense and stark.
