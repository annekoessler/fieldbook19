In chapter two of James Gleick's *The Information*, I was particularly interested by the definition of logic and how thought processes can either comply with this meaning or not relate to it at all. On page 38, Gleick defines logic: "Logic implicates symbolism directly; things are members of classes; they possess qualities, which are abstracted and generalized." As a literate person who was raised in this similar ideology of learning, I agree that I do think about associations that may emerge from questions from categorizing and generalizing information. However, this is not something I actively have to be aware of; instead, my thought process comes naturally. In contrast, the work among illiterate people in the 1930s from Russian psychologist Aleksandr Romanovich Luria revealed insight into how illiterate (and even slightly literate) people thought through answering questions. While they understood the question, oral people struggled to answer since they lacked the categories that are second nature to people in literature cultures. Gleick uses the example of geometric shapes to further break this down. I was fascinated by this example because it honestly never occurred to me that someone's thought process could solely center around a smaller culture's own perceptions. It is hard to imagine this, given the time we live in now, but this reading also reminded me of Jijingi's storyline in Ted Chiang's *The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling* 

When there is a dispute over which tribes should merge together based on ancestry, Jijingi, now a literate and writing scribe, goes through a different thought process to help resolve this issue. When he was younger, Jijingi's connection to being Tiv was much stronger as we see him struggle to understand Moseby's lessons on writing and even lightheartedly mock Moseby for his "European" tendency to write everything down, as if he is an elder man who will forget. However, at this point, Jijingi has well mastered his writing and even thinks through a different lens when trying to resolve the issue of the tribes merging. Once he presents the written European document of a heritage line that contradicts Sabe's words, Jijingi realizes his disrespect. Sabe says, "Have you studied paper so much that you've forgotten what is to be Tiv?" This line was intense and clearly showed how Jijingi's thought process gradually molded into one of logic, thinking about issues as categories and associations to solve things. Sabe, however, makes the powerful point that he should trust his word over some written text. This made me think: does written word have more power than its oral origins? I think back to how Jijingi describes hearing Kokwa tell a story and how it felt differently (hearing his voice, seeing his hand movement, etc.) when compared to the lifeless words on paper. 

Last thought: The other storyline about Remem in Ted Chiang's piece left me buzzing with thoughts and questions. It is clear that this digitization of *real-life* memories can be dangerous (I think about the Black Mirror episode with a similar concept of recording everything you do). It leaves me to wonder if I agree with the narrator's statement (on the last page) that a scenario like the narrator's and his daughter Nicole's is what Erica Meyers predicted when she talked about Remem's effects on relationships. Although the narrator ends up realizing his fault as playing the victim thanks to Remem, I can't imagine having such videos so easily accessible to be healthy, let alone encouraged. I believe that personal memories are the best kind and we should not have record of several (probably insignificant) memories.
