In our fourth lab, we had the opportunity to learn how to set type on the letterpress. Before we could get busy with setting our type, it was important to understand how the California Job Case is organized and what its purpose is. As we saw in our lab, the California Job Case is actually quite large in size and this makes perfect sense; you would want a multiple amount of the letters within each "letter" once you start setting up the words you want to print. If anything, the largeness of the board made it easier to pick out letters. However, the difficulty arose in deciphering how to use the California Job Case. 

Its neat and specific organization of letters may be unfamiliar to work with (due to a lack of prior knowledge), but the reasoning behind their placement reminded me a bit of the layout of a keyboard on our laptops or phones. While these two are distinctly unique, there are similarities regarding the frequency of letters and the size/ space that both boards provide for this. "E" is one of the most commonly used letters, so it is placed conveniently on the keyboard for easy access; it is placed near our left fingers and the spacing from "e" to other commonly used letters such as "i" are far enough part for the person to type efficiently since the "i" is close to the right hand and is at an equal distance from the "e". For the California Job Case, its accessibility is rooted in the size and width of the section the letter is in. For "e", it is one of the biggest boxes placed towards the middle. A bigger box often means that more letters are contained in this section, so it makes perfect sense why "e" has so much space. 

Understanding this logic allowed me to further understand the California Job Case better. If I was looking for a less frequently used letter, such as "y" I would look for a smaller/narrower box and could fortunately find my letter more quickly and easily (especially with the aid of the printed out guide we received that labels the California Job Case). While these small yet helpful hints in mind helped ease the process, I definitely still needed to refer to this guide in the lab since it was the first time I was encountering a type case. 

This lab reminded me of the "Learning to Set Type" vocational film from the 1940s. I thought it was so interesting and also admirable how fast the people in these videos were in setting up their type; I only got to a couple lines in this lab, while these people could do my work in minutes! It made question whether the expertise of the work was something achieved from constant practice and work, or perhaps some kind of educational demonstration? It is clear that you have to memorize the layout of California Job Case in order to work as fast as they did so I'm interested in what the most efficient way to learn this would be.

Recognizing text as composed of material letter sorts, spaces, and leading refigures my view of print culture in various ways. First, it helped me understand the hard work and time consuming nature of this process (much like how our last lab made me appreciate the hard work of scribes.) Working with the letters and spaces led me to think about how careful you had to be in preparing these materials for your text; if you ran out of a certain letter and/or spacing, your finalized work could result into an odd-looking text composed with different fonts and some letters representing another one. For example, in one of my classes we are reading Christopher Marlowe's "Hero and Leadner" and in the version we read, "w" is spelled with two "v's", so it looked like "vv" ("VVhere she should sit for men...") Our lab actually helped me read this document since I assumed that the double "v" was representing a "w" in the situation where there were no more letter sorts left. In the past, I would've assumed maybe this was a meaningful and stylistic choice Marlowe made and required further analysis. However, it would make far more sense to just associate this peculiarity with the reality of working with the letterpress. This reality, of carefully planning and being aware of how many letter sorts you have, is something I had not considered before. 

Overall, I am very excited to continue working with the letterpress. I wanted to focus my lab mainly on the California Job Case since this was the first time I have been introduced to it and have worked with it as well. While we set up type for "A Printer's Epitaph" this week, I can't wait to set up type for one of my favorite Robert Frost poems and make it come to life through manually setting up each line, *literally*, letter by letter and space by space. The experience is already so enrichingâ€”and we've only worked on a small part yet integral part of the letterpress process.
