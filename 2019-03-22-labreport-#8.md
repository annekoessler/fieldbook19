Lab eight proved to be challenging due to my inexperience with coding and this inexperience in part shaped my interaction with the content. Because coding is so precise and detail-orientated, I had to pay close attention to small details that I often overlooked. Some of these details included how necessary commas were since they divided groups accordingly. It was important to make sure that you placed the comma outside of quotation marks and included them inside whenever necessary. As I experienced this in the lab, missing even the smallest of details such as the comma would prevent the code from working. And without a working code, I would not be able to immerse myself into the beauty behind coding, even coding as "simple" as the one completed in our lab (compared to the more in-depth programs coders work with.) 

The poem I chose to use in our "Mad-lib" bots was William Carlos Williams' "This is Just to Say." I chose this poem because it is shorter and does not have complex wording, so it would be easier to substitute new nouns or verbs in the new generated poem. After the necessary coding, I was amused with the results: overall, the poem had a very awkward flow and/or did not make sense at times. This did not surprise me; after all, we are composing a completely different poem with new words so it is hard to read this new poem with our analysis and understanding of the original one dominating our minds. 

However, it was exciting to see how much the poem had changed through this lab. Of course, the poem changed because we were switching out words with random ones. But, this lab has affected my view of poetry in a way. Sometimes, one line out of the entire poem had some kind of meaning. When I say it had "meaning", I mean that when I read it, I could come to some kind of conclusion or I felt *something* special or coherent about the piece (as cheesy as that sounds.) This surprised me because I knew that these words were generated from a string of random words thanks to my API key. So, why did I draw a meaning from this literally randomized poem? Is this some kind of reflection on how we interpret words in literary settings?

This strange sense of "poetic meaning" reminded me of the twitter account @poem_exe, which was included in our reading last week in the "Electronic Literature Collection: Bots." In the Editorial Statement, the way these tweets/poems are created here is further explained: 

*In the tradition of ebook bots, it selects 3-4 random lines from different poems in a haiku database and tweets the resulting generated poem every two hours. Perhaps because the bot’s raw materials are traditional haikus—a literary form composed of short, image-driven lines often with strong ties to the seasons and natural landscapes—the results are surprisingly coherent and poetic.*

I am interested in the creator's explanation as to why some of these poems have meanings; since haikus are "image-driven lines" with ties to "seasons and natural landscapes", it is easier to draw universally poetic meanings that are already one with nature or life. And I truly agree that some of the haikus generated in this bot actually make sense. Scrolling down its Twitter page, I am able to make sense of three poems which to me, is a very impressive thing. If only my generated poem had read so coherently! Perhaps, in the future, I could consider using more specifications when coding to yield better/accurate results. 

Moving on, there is the (incorrect) assumption that computing/coding is not a creative process at all, especially when compared to something more conventionally artistic like writing. Because you can write so many different kinds of texts and express your thoughts through endless outlets (satire, poetry, essays, text messages, the list goes on) thinking and doing creative things are almost expected. However, if we think of writing in this way, how different is this process from coding? Coding is technically *writing*, but it is writing in a language different from English, both literally and also in its function/purpose. In Vikram Chandra's "The Beauty of Code", Chandra pulls a very important quote from the creator of Ruby, Matz. Matz draws compelling similarities between what essays and programs ultimately share and do:

*Programs share some attributes with essays. For essays, the most important question readers ask is, “What is it about?” For programs, the main question is, “What does it do?” In fact, the purpose should be sufficiently clear that neither question ever needs to be uttered … Both essays and lines of code are meant—before all else—to be read and understood by human beings.* 

This similarity between two seemingly contrasting modes of writing is so important. First, this breaks down the stereotype that coding is not creative. If you consider writing a creative process, then you can't state that coding is not one as well. As Mak states so beautifully, the most influential and crucial aspect of both essays and programs is in its ability to be read and understood by those who come across them. If they are incomprehensible, how else could the essay and program be "read and understood by human beings"? Likewise, how could we make use of or draw meaning from these texts? 

More specifically, I think that the most creative aspect of coding is ingrained in the choices the coder can make. There is a great deal of freedom in the choices you make as a coder, so each choice comes with a personal touch. In this lab, we had the choice to either pull the generated words from random strips of words from our API key, pull words from a list that we ourselves composed or some combination of the two. This choice is creative on its own and is telling of the coder. We get to decide how we want the poem to turn out or experiment with how much the word source affects our poem. For instance, by creating our own list of words, the poem that is generated could sound more like something we would write since the words are our own creative choices. Compared to pulling from lists of random words, the results could be incoherent or not like "us" at all. Choosing to pull from the API key is indicative of perhaps a more adventurous outcome since we are unsure of which words will be generated.
