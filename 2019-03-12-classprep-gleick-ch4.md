In chapter four of James Gleick's *The Information*, an insightful look into Charles Babbage and his influence in England was explored. I thought it was so interesting how Babbage believed that there should be one universal language since all the different languages that existed only confused and misinterpreted communication between different languages/cultures. And on a superficial level, this makes perfect sense; with so many varying cultural expectations from country to country and to add on top, a completely different language spoken, it is almost expected that different cultures struggle in communicating with eachother. What I find most interesting in this problem is how Babbage wishes to solve it. 

Creating a universal language among all people who reside in this world is such an elaborate and ambitious goal. First, how would this even logistically work? If you struggle communicating in the first place, how can you get this grand idea in action? In addition, who are you as a person to be entitled to creating the *only* language to exist? I believe that languages are integral to a place's culture and speaking in different tongues not only forms a community, but it also allows a person's identity to take shape. My mother is from Japan and she finds comfort in being able to speak her native language here, in America, with her other Japanese friends and with her family members on the phone. And sometimes, she cannot express the way she feels in English, so speaking in her own language can also become comforting in times of difficulty or pain. This special connection to her language (since I cannot understand Japanese, but my father can) allows her to form unique relationships and form special identities. 

All these moral disagreements aside, I can also see where Babbage is coming from. The world would be a much simpler place if we were all able to communicate under the same tongue. Imagine how ideal this situation would be: no longer any communication gaps, a less scary approach of traveling overseas alone, and most importantly, a definite language that removes any ambiguity or confusion like it creates in our world today. 

While Babbage acknowledges that this language must have "universal, transparent, and immutable" symbols, he also realized how creating such a language was close to impossible. Despite getting as far as creating a grammar, Babbage runs into trouble of storage and retrieval when he writes down a lexicon through this language-creating process. However, he offers an interesting opinion about how language can be created: "Nevertheless he felt that language was a thing a person could invent. Ideally, language should be rationalized, made predictable and mechanical. The gears should mesh" (90). To begin with, anything that is meant to be universal should be "rationalized, made predictable and mechanical" since these qualities are straight forward and are clear. However, I still believe that it is strange that Babbage flat out states that language can be invented by people. Of course, this is how the languages seen today have been created; people are integral in this process. What is odd here is how Babbage believes a person can create *one* universal language. This seems faulty for several reasons; how can the language you speak natively not affect this new one? Again, as I said before, what makes a person entitled to creating a language intended for universal use? These moral concerns, to me, seem very pressing.
