It is interesting to think about how much influence newspapers have in the world today. With such a grand increase of digital publishing and digital access to news, it seems like most people learn about breaking news stories through their screens--whether it is through a tweet or a Snapchat story. No, I am not discrediting physical newspapers today as their importance still remains integral into the lives of many people. However, it seems that news stories are able to reach far more people and in a quicker way with the online world. With this always comes pros and cons: while we get this information faster, we must be cautious of the source's credibility. Because of the accessibility and immediate nature of these sites, it is easy for someone to publish fake news and at times it can be difficult to find truth within endless pages of Google results. 

In our seventh lab, we had the chance to engage with newspapers from the 19th century. Analyzing and interacting with these newspapers was extremely telling of this century's values and I was mainly interested by the way advertisements were framed in its pages. I looked at two newspapers: the *Salem Gazette* (1837, Salem, MA) and the *Democratic Watchman*. (1880, Bellefonte, PA) While these newspaper volumes were both published in the northern part of America, there is a distinct age difference between them--about 40 years. This was important to me since I wanted to get a glimpse into the 19th century newspapers with one towards the beginning and the other towards its end. In addition to this difference in age, it is important to acknowledge how these two places (Salem and Bellefonte) also differ because every town carries its own values and news. While looking for the differences and similarities between the two newspapers in this lab, I found some qualities the two  shared and did not share; the overall style/layout of the page was very similar across the board, while the advertisement styles differed from newspaper to newspaper. 

First, I want to explore the similarities between these two newspapers and compare some of these qualities with the newspapers we see today. Both newspapers were very text heavy, meaning that there were few blank spaces on the page. Sometimes the page would be completely full of text with just a few thin lines running down dividing the columns to organize the page. This immediately stuck out to me because I was not used to seeing such an immense amount of text in a newspaper. Newspapers today have more spacing and blank spaces--not to say that they contain less content but that newspapers today are just formatted differently. For instance, newspapers today have headlines for each article, which basically sum up the event in a catchy and intriguing way. However, headlines were completely absent in the two newspapers I viewed. This led me to believe that newspapers during this time did not prioritize reporting breaking-news stories because it simply would be too difficult. How could someone report relevant "breaking news" close to its occurrence considering how much effort and *time* goes into physically printing these pages? This news development probably would not be released until far after a more relevant date. Thus, I believe focusing on events occurring in the paper's community and surrounding areas was prioritized more. This significant similarity I found led me to believe that a newspaper in the 19th century meant something completely different from what they mean to us today in 2019. 

I believe that newspapers in the 19th century were a glimpse into that town's particular culture and that they reported anecdotes that may not be seen as commonly today (such as "smaller-scale" news stories that would be deemed more worthy on a blog extension of a main newspaper, rather than the print.) Because these newspapers were circulated in the 1800s, it would be close to impossible to report global news. Since communication with and knowledge about other countries was not as accessible or easy like today, so much of the content in these newspapers remained local and specific to the town and/or state. Therefore, I believe newspapers were a way for people in this community to be aware of what was going on specifically in their vicinity and to gain as much circulated knowledge as they could at the time. This contrasts with today's purpose of newspapers: to be informed of news occurring all over the world, and for us, especially in America. With the help of the Internet, this has been made even easier since people can be informed of breaking-news almost instantly after it occurs. Also, I noticed that some newspapers in this lab were purely political, such as the *Democratic Watchman*. Today, our newspapers tend to cover very universal news (such as global political events, breaking news across cities, and even noteworthy local events.) Perhaps very specific newspapers, such as a Democratic one, was easier to provide content because it was so specific in its content manner. 

Moving on, I want to touch upon the differences among these 19th century newspapers. Because I did not find any glaring differences within the overall content or text of the newspapers, I want to focus on the differences between the advertisements displayed in each. In *Salem Gazette* I noticed that a majority of the ads were all jumbled together on the page and were titled with a general field that the ad pertained to (such as "Insurance", "Medical" and "Sales".) 

However, the most striking ads were the ones that had the most white space and this makes perfect sense; white spaces attracts the eye in a sea of heavy text. A couple pages in, I was honed in a very simple ad for *Tyson's Liniment*. The textual content of the ad was so stupidly yet effectively simple: "EVERYBODY USES TYON'S LINIMENT". By repeating each word of this phrase so many times that it ran down almost an entire column of the page, the reader was distracted by the white space and its simple message was easy to read and remember. Even when I flipped through the paper and would see this ad again, I would read it *another* time again instinctively--regardless of the fact that I already knew what the message said. This revealed to me how creative newspaper creators had to be during this time; they did not have the technology we have today in our ads (such as vibrant photographs and graphic design allowing for intricate displays). Likewise, there was an ad for a printing job that was composed into an "X" shape. This was another creative way of attracting the reader and worked effectively to gain the attention of the intended audience. Someone who could appreciate this detail would probably find the job interesting--which is a huge plus! 

In the *Democratic Watchman*, I found a very big difference between the ads found in the other newspaper. Instead of heavily depending on composing creative displays of text in shapes and using a lot of white space, these ads had detailed, stamped illustrations. Now, these clearly aren't physical images that we would see today, but rather they were symbols or representations of the company that would be stamped right in the ad. This added a powerful effect to readers in this time: by associating a symbol (or icon) with your brand, the consumer would most likely recognize this image across the different versions of the newspaper where the ad may repeat again. This familiarity with the illustration could possibly lead to a wider audience, and hopefully, more sales. Making this connection is very similar to how we today associate certain ads with their quirky and unique characteristics (like the Kit-Kat "breaking the chocolate" sound in their distinct ads.) It is clear that companies, even in the 1800s, understood the importance of originality and standing out. And these ads, whether it was the use of white space or illustrations, truly were memorable.
