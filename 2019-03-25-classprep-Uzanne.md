Reading Octave Uzanne's "The End of Books" was very interesting since I kept comparing his predictions about the future's handling of art and media to how books and other forms of media actually exist in our world today. Since this text was written in 1894, I was actually a bit surprised at some accuracies in the text and also found some other ones very dramatic (or too complex to fathom.) More specifically, I was interested in what Uzanne had to say about how journalism would be transformed. Towards the end of this text, he further elaborates this idea:

â€œJournalism will naturally be transformed; the highest situations will be reserved for robust young men with strong, resonant voices, trained rather in the art of enunciation than in the search for words or the turn of phrases; literary mandarinism will disappear, literators will gain only an infinitely small number of hearers, for the important point will be to be quickly informed in a few words without comment."  

First, I want to acknowledge that the specific details and language are not the most accurate aspects of these statements. Instead, the basic concepts behind each idea is what resonated with me the most; in reality, how accurately could a 19th century bibliophile capture the future? I'm already impressed by just the general ideas he has about journalism's growth. 

When Uzanne says, "the highest situations will be reserved for robust young men with strong, resonant voices" I immediately thought about news anchors. Their role as a news anchor is to deliver important news ("highest situation") through clear and engaging speech by speaking very clearly and passionately ("strong, resonant voices".) Likewise, news is generally broadcasted through some sort of video or audio media; although newspapers are still integral today, it seems like a majority of people hear about news stories from listening to the radio in the car or from flipping through the TV channels. 

Another interesting point Uzanne brings up is how news will "be quickly informed in a few words without comment." Again, this reminds of how journalism operates today. While some news outlets are notorious for being too opinionated that it affects the story, the main ethical goal of journalism is to deliver news in an unbiased way, much like how Uzanne describes journalism as being words without comment. While I am still unsure whether today's reality of journalism is what Uzanne specifically envisioned, I am sure he would be content with how some of his thoughts are actually defining terms of the journalism field today.
