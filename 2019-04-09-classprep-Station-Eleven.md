Our reading of Emily St. John Mandel's *Station Eleven* for today's class has kicked off in a great way; not only was Mandel's writing engaging, but the story and characters she has crafted are very exciting to read. At my last co-op, I was responsible for categorizing subgenres within the broader science fiction genre so I was always surrounded by books of this nature: post-apocalyptic books, dystopian books, etc. Although I have been exposed to these titles, I never actually read them. So far, it seems that *Station Eleven* is a post-apocalyptic book because it is narrating a world post a horrifying pandemic (Georgia Flu), leaving millions dead and those who survive live in a completely different world from before--no more TVs, no more airplanes, and fast-food chains left to rust become shelters for survivors. 

On another note, I also appreciate how Mandel sets up the book. She goes back and forth from the world before this destruction and to the present in this new, harsh world. She also cleverly shows interactions between two (seemingly) different characters from different (yet still close) storylines all throughout the book as it progresses. I'm thinking about the scene when Miranda is smoking a cigarette outside with a paparazzi, who ends up being Jeevan: the first character we get to learn about! Side note: this is one of my favorite thing authors implement in books since it is very effective in keeping the reader alert and on their toes for the next connection.

In addition, I enjoyed reading about the Traveling Symphony and their journey in this unforgiving universe. Kirsten is a great character so far since she seems the most relatable to me. She's still trying to figure out how to navigate in a world that she is now a part of, which I find is very honest and telling of her character. On page 66, the Traveling Symphony are performing *A Midsummer Night's Dream* in St. Deborah in front of a crowd. Kirsten comments on the surviving age of Shakespeare: 

"Lines of a play written in 1594, the year London's theaters reopened after two seasons of the plague... Some centuries later on a distant continent, Kirsten moves across the stage in a cloud of painted fabric, half in rage, half in love." 

This parallelism is uncanny. Bringing up the fact that theaters had performed this very play after their own suffering of plagues seems almost identical to the situation Kirsten is in: performing Shakespeare in a post-pandemic world. In both cases, these performers are trying to entertain people and allow them to escape momentarily from the bleak reality that is their life. I also find it fascinating that even several centuries later, Shakespeare still has that much literary prominence. Will Shakespeare always be dominant when it comes to "high-class" performances? I am surprised by this, and it makes me wonder why Mandel chose Shakespeare over every other new play or writer since his time.
