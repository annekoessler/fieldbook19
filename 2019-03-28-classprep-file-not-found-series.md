Preserving digital data is a far more complicated process than I originally thought. When we explored the archives in our second lab, the physical hardships old manuscripts and text had were clear: from the yellow colored pages to the particular dried-out stench the texts composed of parchment had. Preserving physical texts requires hard work and must follow very specific details, including the temperature and levels of humidity it is stored in. This detail-orientated process initially made me believe that preserving digital data was a much simpler process; everything that is online exists forever, right? This too-common and incorrect assumption is explored in the "File Not Found Series", specifically "The Librarians Saving the Internet." 

First, I loved how this article started off by describing this archive for digital texts as "the library of Alexandria, version two" because it creatively captures the dramatic and important nature behind the work librarians must do in order to preserve this data. One of the strangest occurrences explored in this piece was how government-run webpages are often altered after certain political events, like when President Trump took office in January 2017. 

According to this piece, in 2017 when Trump was in office, the Environmental Protection Agency took down its site: "Climate and Energy Resources for State, Local and Tribal Governments." When the site was back just months later, there were several concerning and obvious changes: 

"According to an October 2017 study by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI), the newly launched domain omitted 'climate' from its title, and approximately 15 mentions of 'climate change' from the main page. There were less resources and links related to climate and climate change, and the 380 page site was cut to 175 pages."

Simply put, this is crazy! How can a document that is solely created for giving local governments resources on how to take action on climate change remove "climate" and "climate change" from its title and main page? These changes seem to reflect Trump's new administration and the policies they wish to follow. However, I never realized that government sites, like this one, could be so altered that it would strip its original meaning to a new kind of text. Not only is this concerning, but it makes me question how many previous sites have been altered without the majority of people realizing this. (Probably too many to count.) I've always understood the Internet to be constantly changing, but this removal of "climate change" from a document so clearly about climate change is just incomprehensible to me. Where can this audience find the resources for this topic now?
