In Bonnie Mak's "How the Page Matters", the concept of *paginae* functioned in my further understanding of how paper not only was a vehicle for ideas, but that the page itself told its own story. Using papyrus as paper may seem outdated today, but the way Mak describes its use in the Egyptian and Greek socities is exciting and eye-opening. Something as simple as *paginae*, or columns, offered so many functions at the time. Mak writes that "designers understood the *pagina* as an organizational device that set important controls on the transmission of ideas and facilitated successful communication." Implementing *paginae* in a work not only sets up the page that is written, but it allows the writer/designer to organize their thoughts and allows the reader to take in this information in appropriate chunks so that not all the information is not incoherently clumped together. Thinking about the page as an organizing tool, it made me flash forward to the way we oragnize text without giving it too much thought today: charts in lab reports are clean and highlight important information from the text, emails are constructed (when done correctly) in short important sections that allow the reader to skim the text for the main subject, and how photographs/illustrations in textbooks may strengthen our understanding of a lesson or concept since we associate this image with that term in the reading. This made me wonder whether these writers at the time also understood how the *paginae* was an organizing tool or if it was just a way to transcribe information down. Is this interpretation of the *paginae* as an organizing tool the way the people at the time understood what *paginae* was? Or is it simply an observation made by scholars? 

Another interesting point brought up in Mak's piece centers around the choice to use parchment or paper as a source to write. Mak writes that this choice "conveys important informatin about the history of that particular page, the environment in which it was constructed, and the purpose and audience for which it was intended." I've never thought of a piece of paper (or parchment) as a glimpse into these observations; after all, isn't what the words are saying on the paper the most important? Not necessarily, as I've learned from this piece. Rather, it is rewarding to learn from these observations. For example, using a certain kind of paper that is richer in quality and is rolled into a scroll may indiciate that its purpose is more formal, is intended for a more "important" audience, and that it should be regarded more seriously. To help myself, I think about how we usually use off-white weight paper when printing our resumes or printing an important document. This choice to use a heavier paper that differentiates itself from the normal white and thin paper comes down to our need to look professional and allow this information to simply stand out.
