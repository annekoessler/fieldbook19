Analyzing a work of literature, whether it is a lengthy novel or a short poem, was a process I previously believed to only be possible through reading and physically interacting with the text. There are benefits in this case: with a physical medium, you can highlight, annotate and make note of any parts of the text that are significant. Likewise, you are able to simply read the text, which is integral in being able to analyze it. In any case, reading is necessary for analysis; without this crucial step, how can you make sense of other forms of data analyses, such as the frequency of certain words versus others? 

While these processes are crucial in analysis, it is incorrect to completely rule out the importance of data analysis of texts, such as the way we've transformed these literary texts into data through R-Studio. In this lab, I will focus on how transforming Jane Austen's works into data has opened my eyes to this new kind of analysis.

First, I was so impressed with how transforming Austen's words into data comes with so many helpful uses in reading a text. Thinking about literature as data has opened my view on how analyzing a text can be done through something as simple as word frequency. The following code for creating a plot of the ratio of word frequency to the overall words in the book, grouped by book so there is no error in displaying overlapping (and consequently hidden) results, was my favorite:

```{r}
plot_austen <- plot_austen %>% 
  group_by(title) %>% 
  top_n(20) 

ggplot(plot_austen, aes(word, count, fill = title)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Frequent, Significant Words in Jane Austen's Novels") +
  facet_wrap(~title, ncol = 3, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
``` 

Initially, I was confused by the plot provided by the previous function preceding the one above where it displayed this information overall (meaning it displayed all the books onto one plot). However, when we ran the code I included, my confusion was clarified. It is always helpful to have a visual display of something since you can see the differences and in this case, the frequencies of particular words over another. Likewise, I found that this code was extremely useful in analyzing a character's importance or a particular jargon used. 

For example, if a certain character's name was used more often than another, we can rank the importance of characters all throughout the book. In this context, the most important character refers to the most instances of a name in the text. Seeing this through data is far more beneficial and made easier than flipping through several pages of an entire book and keeping tallies of the frequency of these names. Done in almost seconds, transforming this information into data makes the process not only simpler, but also can allow us to look up other significant terms in a shorter and more efficient amount of time. 

Furthermore, I also enjoyed learning about n-grams in this lab. It was interesting to see what the Google Ngram Viewer had to offer depending on the information you requested. Just out of curiosity, I entered my name and the results were telling of its popularity. The first spike of the name being cited more started around 1930, then falls, spikes again in 1960, falls, spikes again in the late 1970s, falls and then slightly spikes again in the 1990s. By 2000, the name had dropped again. The highest peak was in the late 1970s and this makes perfect sense; the play *Annie* was performed in 1976. It's interesting to trace this data since it reveals what kind of literature was prominent at its time. By 2000, it is clear that the references of my name are very low in comparison with previous decades. 

Pertaining to this lab, I wanted to see the trend of the term "pride and prejudice" (Jane Austen's work) using the Google Ngram Viewer. The results were what I half-expected: the highest spike is right before 1820 and while there are very small spikes as the years progressed, the trend seems to decrease over the years and by 2000, it is the lowest point of the plot. First, I was not surprised by this spike right before the 1820s since Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* was published in 1813. However, I was shocked to see how low the rest of the data was because *Pride and Prejudice* seems to be such a canonized piece of literature, that I expected to see a steady trend of this mention being higher. Almost everyone I know read this coveted work in high school, or has seen a movie based off this book. 

Viewing the Ngram was extremely helpful in analyzing a book's importance and scholarly attribute over the years. With a clean visual and corresponding decades/ percentages, the viewer can get a numerical value of this analysis. However, the exact numbers were not what particularly helped me; it was the visual aspect of this plot. Being able to see each peak and fall allowed me to understand when these occurred and thus prompted me to research the term with that year.  

Overall, I believe that the machine and human reading work beautifully together in offering new perspectives on literature/ literary works both in the past and present. As we've seen with analyzing Austen's works as plots pertaining to a certain word's frequency and the frequency of being mentioned as well, the results have been extremely helpful. These plots transfer a much more complicated process (compared to if we had done this by hand or just read the document to keep this information tallied) into an easy-to-read and visual aid in understanding this particular data. 

I also want to reiterate how necessary it is to read the text in the first place; without this, the data we receive from the machine would ultimately make no sense. However, even if you do not read the text, you can still make some sense of the Ngram to piece out the historical context or timeline of the document. This goes to show how both the machine and reader work best together, but can also offer new or different information when they are separate.
