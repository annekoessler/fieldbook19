This lab was the final one of the letterpress unit, which is a sad yet reflective feeling all jumbled into one. Having the opportunity to work so closely with the press, and learn each specific detail when it came to composing the type and then actually printing, was very rewarding and beneficial to my understanding of this historical technology. In addition to better understanding this device, I formed a greater appreciation for it; there is far more labor, dedication and patience required for the letterpress, which is something I could only discover through this hands-on lab experience. 

When we were only exposed to the letterpress through readings, its powerful effect did not sink in. I initially remember thinking, *how can this be so revolutionary?* The answer is crystal clear now; being able to set type and print legible text was so powerful in the way that it could reach to so many people. Now, important documents could be reprinted in a more accessible form and people could become more informed on the issues at the time. While newspapers and news outlets back then are not as information-loading as they are today, it was still powerful to reprint works. By reprinting, people today could gauge a document's importance. The more frequently it was printed probably meant that it bore more importance, when compared to a document that only has been printed once. 

Likewise, working with the letterpress changed my view of the handpress period in several ways. To begin with, I gained more respect for the people who had these jobs. Much like how I underappreciated the scribe's work before our third lab, I did not realize how much work goes into composing a text through the letterpress. My partner and I only set type for a brief Robert Frost poem--a short eight lines in total. This pales in comparison with how long and involved the texts these workers were composing in the letterpress' heyday. In one of the videos for our readings a couple weeks ago, you could see these workers quickly and efficiently setting type and the speed/ability these workers possessed showed true mastery and familiarity with not only the California Job Case, but also how leading works and physically preparing the type for print. I was genuinely impressed by this; no wonder the letterpress was useful since there were so many skilled hands doing the hard work! 

I moved pretty slowly when setting type, even by our final lab. Yes, I can account for this since I have a lack of experience and familiarity when compared to professional typesetters. However, I believe that this task also involves *immense* patience, which is something I know I struggle with. It's not all about who can set type the fastest; it's about who can set type quickly in an *efficient and accurate* manner. And with efficiency and accuracy comes patience, since the most respected works are the ones that legibly make sense. In addition, my partner and I struggled with accurately finding the correct spaces to tighten our lines within each separate line. This was very hard to lock down since it was easy for a novice to make small (yet damaging) mistakes, such as using a space for a different size font or not using enough spacing to the point where the words would fall apart when trying to actually print the text. This was a problem we would experience in this lab: Anna (my partner) and I prepared our tablet with the Frost poem and blocks. However, as Professor Cordell noted, our text was not tightened enough for the printing to be successful. In other words, if we lifted up the board the text would most likely fall apart (which is every letterpress worker's nightmare!) This was a disappointment at first, but it also allowed Anna and I to realize our mistakes and go back and hash them out. This part of the lab, preparing for actual printing, was the most difficult for me. It was nerve wrecking prepping since I feared the text would fall apart. Thankfully, we did not lift the board and lose what we already had spent weeks on. What a horrible feeling that would have been!

Thinking about how the letterpress would have *actually* operated back in its day reminded me of the image of the Victoria Press in the *Illustrated London News* from 1861. First, it was so exciting to see women were involved, even if it meant that they had a separate newspaper from men. One of the odd things I first noticed was a young girl in the image, towards the center. It never occurred to me that a younger person would be operating in such a physically straining (and maybe potentially dangerous) lab. Perhaps her role was not as involved as an older woman. Another interesting glimpse I got from this image was the presence of a man in a top-hat right at the center of the image. Aside from literally being at the center, this man seemed important from his top-hat to the more formal clothing he wore (in comparison with the other two men who wore aprons). Seeing men in this work environment was also surprising, as I had assumed the main take-away from the Victoria Press was that it was solely composed by women. However, it would make sense for an important-looking man to be present, perhaps to oversee the operation and make sure everything was running smoothly. We have to remind ourselves that this was the 1800's, and gender roles were hashed out much differently than they are today. 

I was reminded of this image during this final lab, since I felt like I could share a small part of these people's experiences working (obviously at a smaller extent on my end). Did these women in the illustration also find entering spacing in the lines frustrating? Or, was this just second-nature, like riding a bike? I also was shocked at the fact that these female workers were wearing dresses while working. Clearly a social expectation, this should not have surprised me as much, but I cannot understand how they were comfortable in their jobs wearing dresses! I was thankful for the fact that I could literally wear anything today in our lab. Making these small connections between my experience in the letterpress lab and this illustration allowed me to fully grasp the social standards at the time for women, and think more about how much this affected their work in the Victoria Press (compared to the men, who could wear, as simple as it sounds, pants). 

I also think back to the collection Professor Cordell brought into class a couple weeks ago. The books were undeniably old--from the aged paper to the tearing binding--it was clear that we were working closely with books that were most likely created with technology like the letterpress. Skimming through these books was a treasure and a glimpse into the cultural and societal views of the time. For instance, I looked at several books that focused on geography (and the cultural associations involved with each place). Many places far from the United States were labeled as "foreign" or even had some racist undertones in the book's condescending language and tone. This was very interesting to read since it was genuinely shocking; if I read something like that today, I would definitely be confused and assume it was satirical. The tone was very dominant and it only showed me how expressive people could have been in this time. After all, this is not a piece of work that is published all across the Internet, which can reach to so many corners of the world. The publishing realm was far more limited at this point in time, so acknowledging this allowed me normalize what I was reading. In addition, looking at these books further illustrated how much labor and work went into these little gems. Some even had illustrations and I was amazed at all the little intricacies hidden within each page. 

Over everything, working with the letterpress in these labs has given me an insightful look into this period of the time. Instead of just reading about this technology on a screen, I was able to get my hands busy with the work and this active immersion of the work has been extremely beneficial. Now, whenever I see an older book I appreciate all the small details I would have looked over previously--whether it is a change in font (looks like someone ran out of letters) or forming a letter with two other different letters.
