The readings for today have definitely been the most difficult for me to understand so far, probably a result of my lack of mathematical and scientific skills. However, I tried to not let this discourage me. As we talked about in our class discussions before, the conversation around computer science has been dampened by this idea that only a certain type of person can study this subject or be apart of this field. The academic world seems very polarized; there's the humanities versus the com-sci and math people. This is hurtful to our education system since I do believe that it would be rewarding to understand at least the basics of computer science as someone who knows so little. And, thankfully, Scott B. Weingart's "The Route of a Text Message" was a very appreciative read. His "simplified" language in explaining a process that occurs in all our daily lives was so interesting. Because I send texts so frequently throughout the day, I genuinely cared about what Weingart had to say!

One of the most fascinating sections of this piece was his explanation of how instructions on a phone (such as displaying a text message) actually become points of light. Weingart provides many helpful and insightful images, such as the subpixel array of a Samsung OLED display and a diagram of an "electricity sandwich". I never thought of my phone operating on points of light, but now it makes perfect sense. Especially looking at the "electricity sandwich diagram", I can visually see the many layers operating under the phone's glass screen, which then emits light for us, the eye, to see. Weingart offers a detailed explanation of how we read messages through negative space:

"The great strangeness here is that my eyes never see “I love you” in bright OLED lights; it appear on the screen black-on-white. The phone creates the illusion of text through negative space, washing the screen white by setting every red, green, & blue to maximum brightness, then turning off the bits where letters should be. Its complexity is offensively mundane."

My favorite expression in this paragraph is the very last line; Weingart's humorous and honest take on this (to me, very complicated) process lightens the mood and thus encourages me to continue reading. Previously, I honestly never even considered how much work my phone goes through in doing everyday activities--such as sending texts and emails, setting alarms before bed and setting timers when doing laundry. On a side note, I would be interested to see how different (or not different) and complex these other commands are, compared to just sending a text message. Weingart even notes that he is just sending this short message--"I love you"--to his wife, who is in the same house as him and shares the same AT&T network (which means the message is sent to the same tower). How complex can this process become when you have one phone under AT&T in Boston sending a message to another phone under a Verizon network all the way in Melbourne, Australia? In addition, thinking about how text messages are displayed by the brightness of the LED lights of the colors red, green and blue underneath my phone's glass screen is so interesting. It makes me wonder: why these colors? Is it because they can cancel out in order to create this negative space?
