The exploration of the word "meme" in chapter eleven of James Gleick's *The Information* was so captivating and rich in detail. When I first read "meme" in a sentence in this reading, my mind immediately resorted to what I associate memes with: humorous images with witty captions "illustrating" the image that explode all over the Internet--reaching people from all over the world who have access to the Internet. While this is still a valid definition of a meme, I found Gleick's examples, explanations, and anecdotes surrounding this word even more interesting than just a silly wide-spread image. 

Gleick discusses how rhyme and rhythm are ultimately what make people remember a text, or the meme of this text (its lasting impact in people's lives). He describes rhyme and rhythm as "qualities that aid a meme's survival, just as strength and speed aid an animal's." First, I found it so fascinating how important Gleick makes rhythm and rhyme seem. I've always associated these terms as just literary devices that help shape a text or give meaning to it. Until now, I've never fully considered the immense impact rhyme and rhythm have on the survival of the term or word's lasting relevance. I even admit that I remember a text better if there is some kind rhyme or catchy tune; think about those annoyingly catchy pop songs you hear on the radio or those jingles you hear constantly on TV or any other form of media ("I'm Lovin' It!) In addition, I found Gleick's comparison of rhyme and rhythm aiding a meme's survival to how strength and speed aid an animal's own survival very interesting. It's almost as if he is saying that rhyme and rhythm are crucial qualities that improve the lasting effect of the text, just like how animals will better survive with the abilities of being stronger and faster. While this comparison is a bit strange in my opinion, I think it does add value to his overall point of how important rhyme and rhythm are to a meme's survival.  

On a final note, I really enjoyed how Gleick (on page 320) used email chains as an example in making the point that a meme can "motivate its human carriers with promises and threats." Like the sample he implements, we've all probably received these kind of chain emails. It's the kind of "Send this to 20 people or you will be alone for the next 20 years of your life" content I remember, fearfully, receiving through Yahoo! mail when I was in middle school. However, I again never viewed this kind of chain email reaction as a way to carry a meme across different channels and thus grow its impact. And it *does* work; I always forwarded this email in fear that the message of the email would literally come true. This leads me to wonder: why are we so quick to forward these kinds of emails? Are memes prospering off our subconscious fears (such as being alone) and this can sometimes make them last?
