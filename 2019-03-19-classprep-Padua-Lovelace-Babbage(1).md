While Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage were previously explored in our reading last week, I found myself learning even more in Sydney Padua's *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer*. This creative and compelling book is truly one of a kind; I've never read graphic novels or comics before in the past, but this aspect of the book did not distract from the biographical details. In fact, the illustrated comics worked effectively with Padua's notes found on each page and created the story as a whole. I will admit that Gleick's handling of these two historical people was dull and hard to follow, at least in my opinion. The reading for today is just the opposite of dull and I really appreciate all the hard work Padua had implemented in order to create this book. 

In the preface, she states how she initially didn't know anything about Victorian history, science, or mathematics and she describes her relationship with computers as "a grudging truce with sporadic outbreaks of open hostilities." This did not throw me off or make me suspicious whether there is any truth in this book; yes, there are some made-up sections but this is obviously for entertainment. Instead, it reassured me that with enough interest and research on a subject, you can try your best in learning something new (as Padua does with the story of Lovelace and Babbage.) This is a beautiful message to carry and it only strengthened my appreciation for this book and its author.

I was really interested with the story of when Queen Victoria visits the Difference Engine. First, I noticed how every time the Queen spoke, there was a fancy and royal font used that stood out from everyone else's shared font. The use of drop caps was oddly humorous, while still adding authority to her words, no matter how insignificant they seemed. This is a small detail but it only goes to show how creative Padua was in composing every bit of the comic. 

The following quote, which was literally derived from Lovelace's footnotes but placed in context of dialogue in the comic, was very telling of Lovelace's more understanding persona: 
"The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns like the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves." 

In this comic strip on page 62, the Queen simply asks how the machine works. Babbage, unsurprisingly (since he seems to hold a very high view of his intelligence), answers by telling her the formula the Difference Engine uses to compute its log tables. Now, while this answer does technically answer the Queen's question, Babbage doesn't seem to understand that he is speaking to a non-mathematical audience. So why does he answer with an equation? It clearly won't be effective here. However, it is Lovelace who responds with the quote I pulled above. While this still lingers with further questions, the wording is much simpler and by comparing the unknown with a more well-known device, such as the Jacquard loom, she helps the Queen understand the machine's functioning better. This consideration on behalf of Lovelace reminds me of how she is often described as the imaginative and hypothetical thinker, compared to Babbage who is viewed as the more technical and literal thinker. I wonder how accurate these descriptions are and how much it matters to place these different labels between them. In the end, aren't they a good team, all differences aside?
