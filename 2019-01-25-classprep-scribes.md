In Ælfric's "Preface to Genesis: A Translation", I was captivated by the way the role of a scribe was explored. Before we can explore what constitutes a scribe, it's important to define it; a scribe is a person whose job was to copy out documents on different mediums before printing was invented. The last sentence in Ælfric's work stuck out to me the most: "The bad scribe does much evil if he will not correct his errors." In this ending paragraph, Ælfric apologizes for any mistakes future scribes may make when re-writing his own work and that "it is then his peril, not mine" if these mistakes take away from the original meaning. First, it is interesting to note who he addresses: "ealdorman". Is this a powerful figure who would be affected by the author's choice to stop translating texts into English? I am curious as to what this relationship entails. In addition, this last sentence is so captivating since it boldly states that it is a great dishonor for a scribe to not do his job perfectly; that is, he must be aware of any errors made. I never thought about the pressures a scribe may have felt under the circumstances. This text leads made me to think about Geoffrey Chaucer's subject matter in his poem "Chaucer's Words to His Scrivener": the evil of a scribe's mistake. Chaucer writes: 

	It to correct, and eke to rub and scrape;
	And all is through thy negligence and rape. 
	
The frustration and annoyance of Adam's mistakes is palpable here, and Chaucer even exaggerates to the point of comparing this lack of attention to something as horrific as rape. While I am still unsure what to think about this comparison, I do believe that this poem only further supports the validity and seriousness behind a scribe's duty and their one goal to simply not make mistakes. In addition, I was curious as to who "Adam Scrivener" is (the man Chaucer is directing this poem to). Is this an allusion to Adam, the first man in Genesis? Or do we have to look further into Chaucer's own personal life in order to fully understand who he is directing these feelings towards?

There was another powerful statement about scribes in Johannes Trithemius' excerpts in *In Praise of Scribes*. After discussing the laborious  work and dedication scribes experience in their duty, Trithemius states: "Scribes are therefore the heralds of the will of God, which they have transferred to us through writing." I've never thought about scribes in such a holy and spiritual way, but it is clear that scribes of religious works were highly respected. This should not be surprising since these scribes were recording down the word of God, and therefore carry out His message to everyone else. Even the title of Trithemius' own work (*In Praise of Scribes*) speaks magnitudes of truth to its message: scribes are crucial in documenting God's word and carrying it on through its immortalization as a codex through time. 

Finally, I found the video about manuscript creation so informational but also still beautiful! The thought about using animal skins as a medium to write on was unappealing at first. However, after watching that video, I found the process oddly satisfying and informative of the time it was used. This may be a silly comment, but I never really understood the origin/ use of a feather as a pen, despite the fact that I associate a feather with a writing device people used centuries ago. Therefore, it was very cool and helpful to see the explanation behind the feather's use to form certain characters when writing.
