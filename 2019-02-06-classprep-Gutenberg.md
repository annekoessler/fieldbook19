Stephen Fry's video, "The Machine That Made Us", offered such a great visual and informational glimpse into Johannes Gutenberg's life. An influential figure, Gutenberg's introduction of the printing press to Europe clearly left a large impact on the world, even to today; books are so readily available to us that it is hard to imagine a life without such accessibility. When Stephen Fry visits Mainz, the city where Gutenberg grew up, I was interested by what some local historians had to say about Gutenberg. First, I found that the statement that Gutenberg had to have been "an engineer, a merchant and an intellectual" very reflective of the moveable type printing press he created. The practical building skills necessary of an engineer, the trading skills necessary of a merchant, and finally the fundamental core knowledge of printing (and the need of/association with books) necessary of an intellectual all combine together to constitute a working person as effective as Gutenberg. When the local historian of Mainz also described the physical rooms the scribes lived in, it reminded me of our last lab! She describes the room as smaller (to contain more heat), having windows (for light) and then, of course, using candles when there was no longer sunlight. Not only was it interesting to imagine these rooms in comparison to the huge and open room they were in during this scene, but knowing about the comments the scribes left in the back of works (like how much their eyes hurt) was a great feeling since we learned about this in the lab. As we hear more about Gutenberg, I wonder how our history would have been shaped if he never introduced Europe to this printing press. Would a development this important still occur around the 15th century? If not, how differently (or not) would the printing world look today? 

Johannes Gutenberg is mentioned within the first few pages in chapter two (The Book as Content) of Amaranth Borsuk's "The Book". I found it so interesting that Gutenberg almost did not receive the credit for his invention due to a suit that forced him to hand over his "lab" where the Bible and his work were located. It always seems like famous historical figures are never popular or recognized during their lives (think about Emily Dickinson). I wonder then, how do we know that Gutenberg is responsible for this invention? "The Book" even mentions that "Gutenberg's celebrity is all the more improbable, given that he did not write a word of the text, design it, or print his name in the completed codex." I'm interested in understanding this better!
