Woah. Jon Bois' "What Football Will Look Like in the Future" was crazy interesting. I think I am still confused with what I've seen, read and watched but it is still a rewarding feeling! First, I was not expecting the page to almost "burst" in the way it did when I first clicked on the link and then display a retro-looking calendar for the year 1943. I was confused why we had a reading with the word "football" in its title, but the medium that this project has been displayed on is the most interesting and beautifully crafted one I think we've seen all semester. This kind of layout reminded me of our readings for last class, but Bois' work relies more on the visual aspect to grab the reader's attention and (for me at least) be confusing as well! 

The Introduction was extremely effective in "drawing in the reader," a quality that many English professors stress to their students when writing essays. I believe the ambiguity in the beginning, with a sporadic exchange of conversation between two unnamed things (I honestly don't know how else to classify these subjects so I won't make an incorrect assumption.) However, the reader naturally wants to believe that this conversation is between two people and there is even personal and emotional language used that is very unique to people: "I love you", using several curse words, and the use of punctuation. These have an effect on the reader because we can relate with what is being said, no matter how confusing or unclear the subjects of this work are. So, when I scrolled towards the bottom and realized this conversation was actually between space probes, I was stuck. Is this literal, or should it be taken "figuratively?" If so, what does that mean in this context?

A small final note: I really enjoyed how Bois displayed the first conversation across several calendars. This not only physically represented the rift in conversation and extreme distance (literal and time-wise) between the two things, but it was also pleasing to the eye. Presenting the "Introduction" in this very specific way was successful to me because of my consequent engagement with the text.
