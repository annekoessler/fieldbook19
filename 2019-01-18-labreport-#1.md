After the first week of class, I think back to Lisa Gitelman's "Introduction: Media as Historical Objects" as I apply the conceptions of media to real life situations, such as our first lab. Unlike Marshall McLuhan's piece, Gitelman offers a much more fluid and applicable definition of media that I find more helpful when conceptualizing such a broad term. Prior to this class, I could not accurately describe what media *actually* is. Before reading Gitleman's piece, in all honesty, I only thought of media as the technology we commonly use and see today: cellphones, tablets, laptops, etc. It did not occur to me to use this word when talking about the many vehicles people used to deliver a message, even something as "ancient" as a telegraph. 

After Gitelman discusses how media "share some of the conventional attributes of both art historical objects and scientific ones", she purposely decides to make her definition of media not as rigid, but rather more applicable to all types of media. I believe this decision was not only a great choice, but it also allows the "muddiness" of this openness to thrive. Muddiness is clearly not a positive word, but I believe that if Gitelman tried to further specify and ultimately over-generalize this definition, that it would be very misinterpreted by others and would be an ineffective definition. A word shouldn't be broken down to smaller descriptions/qualities just for the sake of eliminating ambiguity, especially with something as large of a term as "media". To clarify, Gitelman's definition is far from ambiguous since she plays off a set of qualities that allows a person to apply a specific type of media with these qualities. On page seven, she states her definition of media: 

"I define media as socially realized structures of communication, where structures include both technological forms and their associated protocols, and where communication is a cultural practice, a ritualized collocation of different people on the same mental map, sharing or engaged with popular ontologies of representation."

There is clearly a lot to unpack in this definition, but I first want to note how despite using generally light and simple words/terms, Gitelman still lists several specific attributes that constitute what a media is. This clear reading ultimately leads me to favor her definition and want to apply it when thinking about different kinds of media. Because this definition operates on a list-like organization of the qualities that define a media, anyone can have a type of media in their mind and apply it to each "listed" quality (i.e. "socially realized structures of communication). For example, consider the use of parchment (animal skins), a type of media that was commonly used several centuries ago. When we ask ourselves how parchment is a type of media, it is important to reflect on this first part of the definition; we need to put a type of media in context with the time it was used. People may have used parchment since killing animals provided much more material to work with (especially bigger animals) and the material itself was smooth to write on. Also, it's important to consider that this may have been the best and most efficient source of media then. At the time, this was most likely the best way to structure the communication and ideas flowing throughout a society. I think that Gitelman nicely adds onto her definition  when she says that media's "histories must be social and cultural, [and] not the stories of how one technology leads to another." As she explains, it is crucial to not only be aware of the media in relation to the social and cultural context of its use, but to also utilize this information in our study and its application of its use. 

Moving on, I want to apply Gitelman's piece to our own lab. Markdown is an application that uses plain text formatting syntax and thus allows the file to be converted to many other output formats. While far more complex than the parchment media, it's important to recognize that Markdown is a type of new media (similar to what I perceived media to be prior to this class). Despite the technological differences Markdown has with parchment, both mediums function as "socially realized structures of communication". Today, with the increasing use of computers and technological applications, Markdown is valuable in that it allows a person to communicate their ideas/words through an easy-to-read syntax for formatting plain text. Additionally, its ability to convert to other format types and open in most other applications is extremely valuable. 

When thinking about Gitelman's definition of media, I was able to apply her reading in our lab by using Markdown to type down my thoughts. While reading about theories of media is important in understanding them, so is physically using a type of media to carry out its ultimate use: transferring ideas and communication. While using Markdown in the lab and over this past week, I think that its use is not only extremely valuable, but it made me think about its relation to media and materiality. Much like any other kind of media, Markdown's physical appearance speaks for itself: its two separate columns (the left black side displaying the "background" view of "html" text and then the right, white side displaying the text that actually appears when opened and viewed) show a great advancement of how media allows for materials to be immortalized and transcribed into resourceful documents. Now, with applications like Markdown, we are able to store files through several repositories and access these at our convenience.
