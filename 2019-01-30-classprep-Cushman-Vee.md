Reading about the need for perseverance of the Cherokee syllabary in Ellen Cushman's "We're Taking the Genius of Sequoyah into This Century" left me with many thoughts and reflections. First, I really enjoyed how Cushman distinguishes the different meanings between "perseverance" and "preservation" since it can be easy to mix these up (the spelling is eerily close). With a grasp on what she means by perseverance, "a place where Native cultures and languages enact part of their sovereignty", I was able to envision the bigger picture encompassing her argument about the Cherokee syllabary and how its lack of oral use/ intended way to study (not the Western way or through the aid of an alphabet) is leading to a decline in the Cherokee language. I believe that Cushman nicely encapsulates these ideas when she writes: 

"My hope is to show that even the smallest acts of reading and writing with the syllabary and speaking Cherokee contribute to a longstanding tradition of language perseverance, a tradition of activism that traces from Sequoyah's own political maneuverings." 

My favorite part about this quote is her emphasis on the fact that actively practicing this language (through writing with the syllabary and speaking Cherokee) will ultimately allow this culture and language to be persevered, and *not* preserved. This is an important difference! In this particular situation, I believe preserving the culture/language is when you choose to include the alphabet (an outside force that did not influence the creation of this language in the first place) when trying to decipher the language. This led me to some questions; is it fair to implement something familiar to your own culture, such as the alphabet, to keep another language alive? Or is this ultimately contributing to the preservation of Cherokee syllabary that is the ultimate issue concerning this article? 

How we study/ interpret a language led me to think about how Annette Vee deals with literacy in her introduction, "Computer Programming as Literacy". Vee writes, "The success of the alphabetic West...implies that underdeveloped areas should recapitulate the development model of the West." This reminded me when the Cherokee syllabary was taught with the aid of the Roman alphabet and unsurprisingly, failed. Are the Roman alphabet and the English language such a "success" that "underdeveloped areas" should follow their own method(s) of teaching? As seen with the Cherokee syllabary, we know this is not true and such assumptions like that should never be made.
